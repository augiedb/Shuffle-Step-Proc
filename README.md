# ShuffleStep

This program is being written for an upcoming [ElixirDose.com](http://elixirdose.com) article.

This program is an update of the Shuffle_Step repo, in which we run 1000 shuffles to see if it mixes a deck of cards well.

This repo is going to do the same thing, but add multiple processes to it.

There's a mix dependence in here for Elixir 12.3-dev.  You might want to change that if you're not running the most up-to-date version of Elixir and Erlang.
